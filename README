ALDsuite
========

Suite of tools for inferring Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium
and testing disease association hypotheses

WARNING - this is still an early beta version and under heavy development

Versions
========

0.4.0 - February 6, 2014
  Modifying general algorithm to take MH sample of G before updating HMM
  Initial version availalbe on Github

0.3.7 - December 12, 2013
  Playing with marker selection in setup.prior()

0.3.6 - December 10, 2013
  Add modeling of genotypes in addition to haplotypes again (as in pcr.prior from 0.2.1)

0.3.5 - December 6, 2013
  Going back to simpler things - sampling from gammas again
  Smaller default value for cM.linked makes more sense and gives much better results

0.3.4 - December 4, 2013
  Trying a sampling technique that is a hybrid of 0.3.3 (too noisy)
    and 0.3.2 (not enough room for European chromosomes to come out)

0.3.3 - December 4, 2013
  Fixed small bug in P.recombination()
  Trying new sampling technique for G -- didn't quite work, but shows promise

0.3.2 - December 3, 2013
  Playing around with sampling of G -- didn't work

0.3.1 - December 2, 2013
  Rethinking of the prior distributions of beta and Beta

0.3.0 - November 29, 2013
  Going back to v0.1.2 (using phased data)
  Using pag similar to v0.2.0 - full support on both upstream and downstream
    sides of the anchor marker. Using the allele frequency when there is a
    recombination.
  Using pcr.prior from v0.2.0 - no separate upstream / downstream models

0.2.1 - November 25, 2013
  Variation on v0.2.0 that uses genotypes rather than haplotypes
  Didn't work, pag is not good enough at distinguishing gammas by itself

0.2.0 - November 23, 2013
  Attempt to sample chromosomes differently - using this in a
    Metropolis-Hastings sample to infer gammas
  Didn't work, too noisy

0.1.2 - November 22, 2013
  Using phased data

0.1.1 - November 18, 2013
  Instead of tracking non-existant haplotypes, just use the allele frequency
    when there is a crossover.

0.1.0
?

0.0.1 - October 18, 2013
  Many bug fixes
  Spun off data sets into ALDdata package

0.0.0 - August 28, 2013
  First (alpha) version of ALDsuite
